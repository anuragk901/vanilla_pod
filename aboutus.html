					<h3>Our Story</h3>
					<p> The Vanilla Pod is trying to carve its way to become a trusted destination for home-bakers of all levels to learn, 
						be inspired, share their enthusiasm for baking and allow their lovers to get their desired cakes hassle-free. Home to the 
						best recipes, content, tips and tools and of course a platform for all of us cake lovers to buy from our favourite home 
						bakers; we bring baking to life in everything we do.
						<br>Along with a platform to showcase the baking talent of local home-bakers and giving them an opportunity to create presence and demand for their talent, we want to create, educate and inspire our readers to become the best baker they can be. That is why we never show you a cake without helping you make it, reveal a product without a recipe, or recommend anything that doesnâ€™t make you and your baking better. This revolutionary platform is a small step taken to help the world see what you truly are capable of.
					So, for all those people who want to channel away their stress or are hopelessly addicted to sprinkles, buttercream, cheesecakes, The Vanilla Pod is where you belong.</br></p>
